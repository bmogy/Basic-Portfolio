                    <p>Hello, I am originally from memphis tennessee. I moved away from Mempgis a couple of years ago because they job market sucks in memphis and their is not a lot of fun activities in Memphis.I Have lived in a couple of cities. I lived, fairbanks, Indianapolis, Memphis, and Clarksville.I like to go scuba diving anytime i have a chance. It is a fun activity that gives me the  opportunity to be near very large marine life. I have swam with the Whale sharks at the Georgia aquarium and i have swam with goliath groupers at the panama city beach. </p>

                    <p>I also like hiking. I jave hiked up the Mount Masada in israel. It was a very difficult hike, but the pay off was great. I had the chance to see sun rise up</p>
                    <p>I like to think of myself as a care free person. There is not a lot that i don't particually likE, except getting a barny tattoo </p>
